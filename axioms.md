# First Signal Law — Distilled Axioms

These axioms summarize the First Signal Law (FSL), which frames persistence as the interplay of restraint, alignment, and persistence across roles.

### AX18 — Collapse Begins with the Least
> **A system endures if and only if the least endures.**  
*Implication:* The smallest components must persist (e.g., protons, quantum states), or the whole system collapses.

---

### AX19 — Restraint at the Greatest
> **The largest forces must be restrained to sustain complexity.**  
*Implication:* Macro-scale dynamics (gravity, cosmic balance, societal powers) must not overwhelm the smaller; restraint allows the middle to mediate.

---

### AX20 — Alignment in the Middle
> **Persistence arises when the middle aligns the extremes.**  
*Implication:* The middle role bridges micro and macro, ensuring coherence across scales (e.g., spacetime linking particles and galaxies, or mediators linking individuals and institutions).

---

### AX21 — Persistence is Relation
> **Persistence is not carried by one role alone but by their cadence together.**  
*Implication:* Survival comes from the rhythmic interplay of least, middle, and greatest, each rotating through restraint, alignment, and persistence.

These axioms form the backbone of the First Signal Law, offering a lens that unifies physics, systems, and philosophy under one rhythm:  
**restraint → alignment → persistence.**
