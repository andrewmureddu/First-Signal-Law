# Metaphysical Gravity: The First-Signal Law

**Restraint ‚â• Alignment ‚â• Persistence**

---

## Statement of Record

I am not a professor, not a lab, not a research institute.  
I am simply one person with curiosity, persistence, and access to modern tools.  

What I have worked on here I call the **First-Signal Law (FSL)** ‚Äî a cross-domain principle of stability:  

**Restraint ‚â• Alignment ‚â• Persistence**  

I‚Äôve applied it to physics, microbiology, politics, and AI safety. It is falsifiable, predictive, and universal.  
This repository contains my drafts, analyses, and applied research.  

I share this not to claim ownership, but to **bear witness to what is possible**:  
that even an ordinary person, using these tools with care, can discover something that speaks across disciplines.  

If the law proves true, it belongs to everyone. The symbolism that matters is simple:  
*‚Äúa little guy can still find something real.‚Äù*

## What You‚Äôll Find Here

- üìÑ **Research Drafts**: documents applying FSL to physics, metaphysics, and game theory.  
- üß¨ **Applications in Biology**: predictive frameworks for microbial biofilms and clinical contexts.  
- üß© **Systems Analysis**: political and economic models reinterpreted through FSL.  
- ü§ñ **AI & Alignment**: exploration of FSL as a stability check for large language models.  

Each file is a step in refining the law and testing its universality.

## Why It Matters

The First-Signal Law offers a **simple, testable framework**:  
- If **Alignment outpaces Restraint**, systems destabilize.  
- If **Persistence is ignored**, collapse follows.  
- If **Restraint ‚â• Alignment ‚â• Persistence**, stability emerges.  

This applies from the smallest microbial colonies to global politics to artificial intelligence.

## Call to Action

If you are a researcher, engineer, or thinker:  
- **Test it** in your own field.  
- **Challenge it** with counterexamples.  
- **Refine it** if you see a clearer form.  

The law is not mine alone; it is offered as scaffolding.  
If it resonates, build on it. If it fails, disprove it. Both paths serve the truth.
