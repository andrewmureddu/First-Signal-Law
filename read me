Statement of Record
I am not a professor, not a lab, not a research institute. I am simply one person with curiosity, persistence, and access to modern tools.
What I have worked on here I call the First-Signal Law (FSL) — a cross-domain principle of stability:
Restraint ≥ Alignment ≥ Persistence.
I’ve applied it to physics, microbiology, politics, and AI safety. It is falsifiable, predictive, and universal. My work — including data, drafts, and game-theoretic exploration — is openly available on my GitHub.
I share this not to claim ownership, but to bear witness to what is possible: that even an ordinary person, using these tools with care, can discover something that speaks across disciplines.
If the law proves true, it belongs to everyone. The symbolism that matters is simple: a little guy can still find something real.
