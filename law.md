# The First Signal Law (FSL)

**Formal Statement**  
A system persists only when its smallest elements endure, its greatest forces are restrained, and its middle role aligns the two.  
Persistence is the cadence of restraint, alignment, and endurance across all roles.

## Expanded Definition
The First Signal Law formalizes the principle that survival is relational.  
- If the **least** collapses, the whole collapses.  
- If the **greatest** overwhelms without restraint, nothing smaller survives.  
- If the **middle** fails to align the extremes, coherence is lost.  

Persistence arises only when these roles operate together in rhythm, distributing the burden of restraint, alignment, and endurance. This law provides a structural explanation for why complexity can last across scales — from particles to galaxies, from cells to civilizations.

## Generalized Roles
- **The Least** — smallest components or weakest nodes.  
  *Examples:* protons and electrons in physics; vulnerable agents in society.  

- **The Greatest** — largest-scale forces or most powerful agents.  
  *Examples:* cosmic gravity; central institutions in governance.  

- **The Middle** — mediators bridging least and greatest.  
  *Examples:* spacetime geometry in physics; cultural norms in society.

## Universal Applications
The First Signal Law applies across domains:

- **Physics** — persistence of matter requires proton stability (least), gravitational balance (greatest), and spacetime coherence (middle).  
- **Biology** — organisms persist when cells (least), environmental pressures (greatest), and regulatory systems (middle) cohere.  
- **Systems & Economics** — survival requires protection of weakest participants, restraint of largest powers, and mediators that align the two.  
- **Philosophy** — survival itself is the rhythm of restraint, alignment, and persistence.

Embodiments (mathematical scaffolds, applied systems, or engineered controllers) are handled separately and may be subject to additional protection. The law remains open.
