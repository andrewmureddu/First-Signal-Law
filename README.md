# First Signal Law (FSL)

The **First Signal Law (FSL)** describes a universal principle of persistence:  
*Systems endure when their members alternate between restraint, alignment, and persistence, ensuring no part bears the full burden without relief.*

This repository preserves the law itself as public knowledge. It contains scaffolding documents, distilled axioms, and supporting materials that expand the law’s statement and demonstrate its reach across physics, systems theory, and beyond.

## Why This Matters
The First Signal Law provides a lens to unify seemingly disparate domains:  
- **Physics** — bridging General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.  
- **Systems** — explaining resilience in biological, computational, and social structures.  
- **Philosophy** — grounding survival in the rhythm of restraint, alignment, and persistence.  

It is both a research framework and a practical tool for designing systems that last.
